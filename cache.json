Or design products that work on devices yet to be invented?\nFlash, Photoshop, and responsive design\nWhen I first started designing websites, my go-to software was Photoshop. I created a 960px canvas and set about creating a layout that I would later drop content in. The development phase was about attaining pixel-perfect accuracy using fixed widths, fixed heights, and absolute positioning.\nEthan Marcotte‚Äôs talk at An Event Apart and subsequent article ‚ÄúResponsive Web Design‚Äù in A List Apart in 2010 changed all this. I was sold on responsive design as soon as I heard about it, but I was also terrified. The pixel-perfect designs f‚Ä¶",
