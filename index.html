                    <span>Auto Sass
Package for the Atom IDE that takes a Sass file on each save and automatically compiles, lints, prefixes, and saves the resulting CSS code.
Overview
This plugin was something I developed rather quickly and primarily with my own use in mind. I wouldn&#x27;t expect that others would find it any more useful than the myriad Sass compiler packages already out there.

Features
Uses latest Dart Sass Node API
Lints and fixes compiled CSS with Stylelint using nearest .stylintrc config available
Runs Autoprefixer on compiled CSS

                    <span>Giulio Procopio&#x27;s Atom Retro Syntax Theme
This is essentially vendored from Melina Donati&#x27;s 90s-tshirt-syntax,
however some things didn&#x27;t sound like they were right.  For example, reducing
font size of comments causes columns missaligning and preferred line length
basically blows up.
Installation
You may both use Atom graphical package manager and apm for installation.
apm install https://github.com/Giuppox/retro-syntax.git

                    <span>Robotic process automation (RPA) projects are a challenging endeavor. According to a recent survey, 69% of RPA projects fail to take off because of their complexity. And for the lucky ones that manage to proceed to execution, up to 50% of them fail. To further complicate matters, Blueprint, an enterprise automation company, reports that 63% of business leaders are not satisfied with their RPA implementation speed. PwC’s study supports this idea. The consultancy found that conducting an RPA proof of concept or a pilot project often takes 4-6 months instead of the expected 4-6 weeks.However, if companies take on their automation projects prepared and aware of the possible RPA challenges, they can reap great rewards. Many are already benefiting from workflow automation services as the global RPA market increases in value. The Grand View Research forecasts this market to hit $13.74 billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 32.8% from 2020.Also, COVID-19 vastly accelerated automation, despite the pitfalls of RPA deployment. To highlight the significant role of the pandemic, Mihir Shukla, Co-founder and CEO of Automation Anywhere, gave the following example: at one point during the pandemic, a large bank was forced to update six million loan records immediately. Without RPA, such an enormous task would take two years to accomplish.So, why do RPA projects fail? And how to succeed despite the discouraging stats above?</span>

                    <span>The SSH agent (ssh-agent) is an SSH key manager that stores the SSH key in a process memory so that users can log into SSH servers without having to type the key’s passphrase every time they authenticate with the server. In addition to the key management feature, SSH agent supports agent forwarding, which helps to authenticate with servers that sit behind a bastion or jump server. As the agent works as a password manager for SSH keys, incorrect usage or faulty configuration can cause security risks.
In this article, we’ll explore how to avoid potential SSH agent pitfalls and recommend best practices to keep your SSH agent secure.

                    <span>Z3 is a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver developed by Microsoft Research.
With a description like that, you’d expect it to be restricted to esoteric corners of the computerized mathematics world, but it has made impressive inroads addressing conventional software engineering needs: analyzing network ACLs and firewalls in Microsoft Azure, for example.
Z3 is used to answer otherwise-unanswerable questions like “are these two firewalls equivalent?” or “does this set of network ACLs violate any security rules?”.
While those applications dealt with constraints over IP addresses (essentially very large numbers), Z3 can also analyze constraints over strings; this was used to implement AWS Zelkova which analyzes role-based access control (RBAC) policies in the Amazon cloud.

                    <span>TL;DR For the 5th year in a row, we doubled HackerNoon Revenue of the previous year with 2021 revenue clocking in at redacted USD! And, for the first time since we started sending these shareholders newsletters, HackerNoon is profitable again, by redacted! Our primary ad inventories, Top Navigation, Ad By Tag, Brand as Author, and Email Newsletters, all improved in YoY revenue, and new ad inventory from Startups of the Year and Writing Contests also drove revenue up. With regards to traffic, we saw a 11% increase in readers QoQ, a 2% decrease YoY to readers on hackernoon.com, and as of today rank as the #3,990 site on the worldwide internet by Alexa. In-app traffic (app.hackernoon.com) saw a significant bump, with users increasing 62% YoY, and 7.9% QoQ. Software-wise, we strengthened the product team, and in the last 4 months we’ve shipped AI-powered Audio Stories (≈3x avg time on site), About Pages (here are some examples), Terminal Reader, Writing Prompts, Noonies 3.0, Choose Your Color, (revamped) Noonification, Emails, Internal KPI Dashboard Improvements, Open Sourced Font, Internal Changelog History for Every Story Draft, Editorial Notes, (improved) Core Web Vitals, among many other features/fixes/improvements/iterations.</span>

                    <span>SSH bastion hosts are an indispensable security enforcement stack for secure infrastructure access. Every security compliance standard that deals with remote infrastructure access (e.g., FedRAMP AC-17 - Remote Access, HIPAA §164.312(a)(1) - Access control, SOC2 CC6.1 - Manage Points of Access) mandates preventing direct network access to the servers and APIs. Although it is relatively easy to deploy a bastion host in your infrastructure, it should be noted that securing a bastion host requires careful consideration from design to deployment. After all, bastion hosts are the first target for attackers looking to compromise access to infrastructure.

                    <span>The pandemic has uncovered and amplified the struggles the healthcare sector is facing.

Many medical facilities have already turned to healthcare technology companies for a smart hospital makeover, which will help them cope with the pandemic and build their services around the patient. This article provides the market overview of smart hospital technology and highlights some aspects that you can consider before digging into implementation.</span>

                    <span>The concept of microservices, an approach to designing a software application as a set of small services, has been around since at least 2015.Delivering benefits such as the independent deployability and scalability of components, microservices are all the rage today. This is because these microservices benefits translate into incredibly faster software development speeds. With consumers being quick to change their preferences and behaviors, microservices adopters are able to keep up. Life is now great, they say.As much as 56% of companies participating in a recent IMB survey plan to adopt a microservices approach in the next 24 months. Almost 80% of current users say their business will likely step up investment in microservices.Microservices advantages have prompted Netflix, Amazon, eBay, Twitter, and many other tech giants to migrate from monolithic to microservices architecture.But should your company use microservices?It depends on the context and if microservices pros outweigh the cons for your application.This blog provides an overview of a microservices vs. monolithic approach and five key benefits of using a microservices architecture. It also shares some of ITRex’s microservices experience and offers tips on when business should (not) use microservices. Dive in.</span>

                    <span>One way to enhance SSH login security is by using two-factor authentication (2FA). This approach forces an administrator to self-identify with an additional security verification in addition to the local admin credentials.

To follow along, ensure you’ve met the following prerequisites:
Administrative (sudo) access to a running Linux machine — for example, Ubuntu 20.04 or similar
SSH server running on the Linux machine
Preconfigured Google Authenticator app on iOS or Android mobile

                    <span>SSH client configuration files allow us to connect to servers with pre-configured commands. This saves typing each SSH command parameter when logging into a remote machine and executing commands on a remote device.
This article will examine secure shell (SSH) client configuration (config) files and their functions. Specifically, we will show an example of an SSH client config file to learn how to use these files before creating an example config file that connects to a fictitious server. Then, we’ll use Teleport’s tsh client to communicate with a cluster because of tsh’s ability to consolidate identity-based server access in all environments, meet compliance requirements, and provide visibility into access and behavior.

                    <span>I talk to a lot of engineers every day. SREs. Systems Architects. Security Engineers. What I am hearing from them is that they are moving away from passwords — both in their personal lives, opting for more secure forms of authentication like biometrics and second factors, and at work. It just doesn’t make sense anymore to protect your personal bank with a second factor, but to share around an SSH key to access critical server infrastructure.
Passwords are still the leading way to grant access to infrastructure, even though stolen or hacked credentials are the number one cause of data breaches.

But this is changing. Look at the 32% of respondents in our recent The State of Infrastructure Access &amp; Security Report 2021. We surveyed 1000 IT, DevOps and Security professionals to find out what they were thinking about some of the most important security issues at the moment.
Short-lived identity-based certificates are a small part of the overall security toolkit today, but they are rightly seen as superior to SSH keys and other shared credentials that are just passwords by another name.
When asked why they had implemented certificates, people said that they were more secure, more feature-rich, and limited the attack surface in time.

All of this is why 77% of companies view moving towards a passwordless infrastructure as “very important” or “important”. In case you are wondering, they are also adopting zero-trust networks (86%) and just-in-time infrastructure access (89%).
Are you currently implementing passwordless access for your infrastructure? If so, we’d love to help. Reach out and one of our expert solution engineers will help you architect the solution in a way that is not only more secure, but also more agile.</span>

                    <span>As software and hardware engineers around the world are untangling the centralization of the internet, a vocal portion within the enclave of blockchain-based solutions - generally referred to as decentralized finance - or DeFi for short - has emerged. While blockchains provide the building blocks for reliable information and - to a lesser extend value - transport functions  - a layer of middleware to the larger concept of cryptographic primitives mapped by protocols, current developments are largely focused on digitally native assets, and their derivatives. However, a first-principles view on the innovation of financial services will focus on the central tenet of technology: the increase of productivity of human activity, freeing up individuals’ attention — measured in time — that these can assign to leisure activities or higher-order pursuits, such as the accumulation of knowledge. To that end, network technologies, in particular, the internet and consequent emergence of the World Wide Web, amplified human productivity by fueling a surge of synchronous and asynchronous coordination methods of human fecundity, as well as the wider distribution of economic activity in general.</span>

                    <span>We are the fans by Polygon network, that outpacing Ethereum in terms of growth. Yes, layer-two scaling solution is growing faster than the platform. Polygon PoS chain is a hybrid between a sidechain and a Layer 2. It recently passed the milestone of having more daily active addresses than Ethereum! I personally see Polygon as the future of scaling because Ethereum’s proof of stake will not solve scaling issues, and that Ethereum 2.0 will not make the platform infinitely scalable. Instead it will continue to have a limited capacity and will require layer two solutions like Polygon.</span>

                    <span>Background video player / manager for Atom
*** ALPHA VERSION (Not really public ready) ***
*** ESPECIALLY BAD WINDOWS SUPPORT FOR NOW :P ***
Usage
Play videos in background
recommended
use Real_ESRGAN to improve quality of images (not implemented yet)
use thunar script for image_created_by_thunar.jpg and folders &quot;images_created_by_thunar&quot;... (not public yet)
Todo :
shadowRoot bug after inactivity / suspend ?
SOME THEMES PUT COLOR ABOVE BACKGROUND IMAGE (Nord Atom for example)... :(
(Need to edit theme manually, cannot find JS or CSSthat works with !important... - .item-views)
images : not use image if (height &gt; width)
include audio player ?? (use video with displaying,playing audio only ?)
disable video but keep playing audio on focus change, instead of pausing
allow previous video (add button too)
disable / enable line-numbers background color ???
disable / enable dim background
allow to add an unlimited amount of RV / RVL / RI... in settings
range of background opacity in settings
Add button for Real_ESRGAN
ctrl + alt + m : next image ???
transfer to/from mpv player
XTRA (Not directly related to background-video-player but to Atom in general on my personal configuration)
1 - I want to switch displayCodeHighlights on text selection, to see it better on the minimap,
Need to change 2 functions in the &quot;highlight-selected&quot; plugin :
search-model.js :
static makeClasses() { atom.config.set(&#x27;minimap.displayCodeHighlights&#x27;, &#x27;false&#x27;);
selection-manager.js :
removeAllMarkers() { atom.config.set(&#x27;minimap.displayCodeHighlights&#x27;, &#x27;true&#x27;);
2 - Refresh the css right position of wallpaper to avoid minimap by changing &quot;tree-view-autoresize&quot; plugin :
On hide/show tree-view, the background wallpaper goes under the minimap plugin...
tree-view-autoresize.coffee :
resizeTreeView: -&gt; setTimeout &#x3D;&gt; if(atom.config.get(&#x27;background-video-player.underMinimap&#x27;)&#x3D;&#x3D;false) document.querySelectorAll(&quot;.item-views&quot;)[1].style.backgroundPosition&#x3D;&quot;top 0px right &quot; + document.getElementsByTagName(&#x27;atom-text-editor-minimap&#x27;)[0].width + &quot;px&quot;;</span>

A very similar task called image captioning may sound really simple but is, in fact, just as complex. It is the ability of a machine to generate a natural description of an image.</span>

                    <span>During my time as a penetration tester, I’ve seen many IT teams storing server catalogs with respective IP addresses and passwords in a sharable Excel sheet. This is more so true in windows server infrastructure as many organizations resort to password-based auth for local and remote access. Of course, security-conscious organizations would use a password vault. But in any case, password storage in any form is often an Achilles heel in infrastructure security. While there are endless risks associated with password-based authentication, passwords also create an operational overhead for system administrators. Maintaining password vaults to share, store, and rotate passwords can lead to infrastructure compromises.
At Teleport, we have been advocating and innovating passwordless infrastructure…</span>

                    <span>python-virtualenv
Automatic Python .venv activation in current project
When current text editor changes, package searches for .venv/bin/activate file, sources it and modifies PATH for the Atom process.
Currently only .venv is supported, since it&#x27;s most widely used name for in-project virtualenv and many tools use it, such as Poetry.
You can not deactivate virtualenv, but please open an issue if this is an essential feature.
You can see which project&#x27;s virtualenv is currently active in the status bar at the bottom.
NOTE: There are one caveat that you can notice: there may be virtualenv and editor mismatch on Atom startup if files from different projects was opened at editor shutdown.
This is because there are packages, such as ide-python, that execute their logic for each opened editor and require virtualenv for each of them in order to spawn matching python-language-server, but lack the discovery. For example, if you don&#x27;t have python-language-server installed globally (only within project&#x27;s .venv), this .venv must be activated when ide-python attempts to spawn it. And if I ensure that current project is processed last by this package, ide-python will use it&#x27;s python-language-server (if it&#x27;s installed) for any other python files from any project that currently have text editor opened.
AFAIK opened editors processing order is undefined, so I can not be sure that .venv used by ide-python right now and project for one particular opened file match. Only solution is on ide-python side - implement .venv discovery on their own.</span>

                    <span>The Badger DAO attack was conceptually very different from the more traditional attack in DeFi. Those traditional ones are aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities in the code of smart contracts of the protocols, otherwise called bugs. We are familiar with flash loan attacks that use uncollateralised loans across a multitude of protocols to manipulate certain markets and pump-and-dump certain assets. We also know about reentrancy attacks that exploit the logic of execution of functions inside a smart contract. However, the Badger DAO exploit was both more and less ingenious at once.</span>

This high-level document covers the process of becoming FedRAMP- compliant, but the technical details of “getting everything right” are described in the publication Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations maintained by the National Institute…</span>

Many South-East Asia countries focus on providing a legal field for crypto companies to work and managing issuing crypto assets. The regulation authorities look for tax deductions of both individuals and companies if they make profits, trading crypto assets.

                    <span>export-project-html (Atom Package)
A plugin for the Atom text editor that exports the currently open code project to a static website, in a new folder called WebPublish in the project&#x27;s root directroy. All code files are exported to html so that when opened in a browser the code is formatted like it would be in Atom, and markdown files are rendered into rich text too.
export-html package by nubohito (for converting code files to html) and Atom&#x27;s built-in markdown-preview package for converting markdown files to html, many thanks to the developers of those packages.
Usage:
In Atom, press Ctrl+Shift+P and then search for &quot;export-project-html&quot; (&quot;xpro&quot; will do). Then press enter, and your project will be converted to html in a folder called WebPublish.

Issues:
When using fenced or tabbed codeblocks without a specified language, the plugin crashes. This is a known issue in the markdown-preview package, whose code is used in this package.
A workaround is to specify a language for the code block:
For example, in your markdown, don&#x27;t do:
    Hello world example:
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
    import os
    print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;


Instead:
    Hello world example:
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;python
    import os
    print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;


Don&#x27;t do:
Hello world example:
    import os
    print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)


Instead:
Hello world example:
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;python
    import os
    print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
    &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;</span>

                    <span>As you know, Python is a very popular language and already takes 1st place in the TIOBE rating. And in the classical understanding of Python, in 90% of cases, CPython is meant. It is a reference implementation of the interpreter under the guidance of Guido van Rossum. Version 3.10 is current as of November 14, 2021. By now, Python means only version 3, but before this version appeared, mentions of version 2 can still be found. Now version 2 is not supported and most companies are removing the remnants of the code from version 2. by porting the code to version 3. As of January 1, 2020, Python 2 is no longer supported [https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/]. And this is quite understandable since, after the release of Python 3 in 2006, developers had to support 2 versions at the same time, which is laborious.</span>

                    <span>The mistakes of novice programmers, those who are just learning or just starting to work, are very similar to each other. Many of them can be called not mistakes, but behavioral features, stages all beginners go through. We as Java course creators are interested in this topic, so we interviewed opinion leaders and collected the most common, in their view, examples of such behavioral errors in order to … shorten their duration for future software developers. If you start noticing such behavioral mistakes early and try to fix them, your path to mastery will be shorter and your work will be more efficient.</span>

                    <span>language-actr package
A very preliminary version of syntax highlighting for the cognitive modeling language ACT-R.
Some keywords are recognized (e.g. ISA, chunk-type) and buffer-names are treated like functions.
Code folding works (thanks to the code already written for &#x27;normal&#x27; lisp).
Files with the extension &quot;.lisp&quot; are recognized and highlighted accordingly.
I copied the stuff in grammars/actr.cson mostly from a github page on lisp syntax highlighting here:
https://github.com/enriquefernandez/language-lisp
Edit the file grammars/actr.cson if you want to add some patterns to be highlighted or change existing ones.
There is a snippet now, too. Starting to type &quot;production&quot; should open a suggestion on your cursor called production, if you hit enter it will write the structure for a new production.
You can fill it out using tab to go from place to place to complete.
Add or change here: snippets/language-actr.cson
This is how it looks like:</span>

                    <span>Mechanicus Syntax Theme
Initially a blend between Monokai and One Dark, Mechanicus is a camouflage looking color scheme with slightly higher contrast.
The theme works as intended for the following languages: PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Python (as of 4.1.0)
HTML

CSS

JavaScript


PHP

Python

Roadmap
Since I primarily built this theme for myself, the last language I would like to properly colour is C/C++. With the theme as it is, the support is nearly ready, but it is not yet consistent with the other languages. If I decide to move to a new language, I might add consistent colouring for it as well.</span>

                    <span>Hardware security modules (HSM) and trusted platform modules (TPM) seemingly do
the same thing: they manage secret keys and enable data protection.
But what does “managing secrets” mean, and what’s the difference between the
two? Before diving deeper, let’s explore why computers need help with managing
their secrets.
What are TPMs and HSMs for?
Sensitive data needs to be protected, that is why data centers employ physical

I tried about ten million different themes, and tried to figure out what it was I liked about each of them. And this was the result. It&#x27;s a dark theme, but with less contrast so it&#x27;s slightly easier on the eyes. Well, on my eyes at least.
Best used with Victor Mono.</span>

Imagine there is a production outage and a senior SRE needs to login to a production server to diagnose and fix the issue. In this organization, on-call SREs have elevated access to production systems, but when they are off-duty, their privileges are reduced. When the Pager Duty alert goes off, our on-call SRE ssh’s into the server but after several minutes of looking, can’t diagnose the issue. But she thinks a colleague might be able to. The colleague who she wants to help isn’t on call, so doesn’t have SSH access to the box.  Not a problem, she can use Teleport to request temporary elevated access through PagerDuty, Jira or another system which is then approved via the on-call SRE or other required approver and…</span>

This atom plugin highlights the syntax and spell mistakes in your editor.

Features:
Highlight mistakes
Suggest replacing text
Highlight only text in specific scopes (see here)
By default,  highlight correctly latex files and comments in other languages
LaTeX
It&#x27;s advised to separate different blocks (paragraph, section, ...) with new lines to reduce the number of mistakes not
highlighted.
Correcter modules
There is 2 modules implemented:
ginger that work online (using gingerbread library)
languagetool that can work online and offline and support more than 20 languages. Due to the big amount of
requests, it&#x27;s recommended to have a local server.
Languagetool support
If you use a local languagetool server (see here to install your own),
you can give in option a command line that will be executed when the package is activated to try to start the server.
You can add in package option Language Tool Stop Server Command a command that shut down the server when the package is disabled.
Scopes
In the parameters, there are 2 fields (Excluded Scopes and Included Scopes)for the scopes&#x27; management. Both are list
of atom scopes and will be use as regex. To be highlighted, a text must be matched by at least one regex in the
Included Scopes list and none of the Excluded Scopes list.
By default, the package is configured to highlight correctly latex files and comments in other languages.

                    <span>Merge conflicts... Nobody likes them. Some of us even fear them. But they are a fact of life when you&#x27;re working with Git, especially when you&#x27;re teaming up with other developers. In most cases, merge conflicts aren&#x27;t as scary as you might think. In this fourth part of our “Advanced Git” series we&#x27;ll talk about when they can happen, what they actually are, and how to solve them.

Do you leave stakeholder meetings with unclear directives that often seem to contradict previous conversations? You know a better understanding of user needs would help the team get clear on what you are actually trying to accomplish, but time and budget for research is tight.

This lets me see the technologies available and also understand the drivers and issues engineering orgs face adopting them, particularly with onboarding engineers.

                    <span>Although the typical use case of SSH is to access a remote server securely, you can also transfer files, forward local and remote ports, mount remote directories, redirect GUI, or even proxy arbitrary traffic (need I say SSH is awesome?). And this is just a small set of what’s possible with SSH.
In this post, I’ll cover different tunneling features as supported by OpenSSH, which helps achieve security use cases such as remote web service access without exposing ports on the internet, accessing servers behind NAT, exposing local ports to the internet. OpenSSH is the most widely used open-source SSH server. It comes pre-installed by default with the vast majority of Linux distributions.

TL:DR, Buying can save your engineer time for building the core stack and for the fun experiments needed to determine when to shake up the core stack.
As the IT Director at Teleport, I help review every vendor decision. As we have transitioned from a scrappy open source startup to a hyper-growth SaaS company, our priorities have started to shift from quickly deploying lots of free open source software ourselves to buying robust SaaS software to keep our agility and deal with ever-growing scalability, security and compliance burdens. The temptation to build our own systems remains, but when is it the right option to build? In this article, we’ll share an overview of the benefits and drawbacks of b…</span>

                    <span>Latency problem
A multi-protocol access proxy is a powerful concept for securing access to
infrastructure. But accessing numerous computing resources distributed across
the globe via a single endpoint presents a latency challenge.
Today we are announcing that the hosted edition of Teleport Access Plane is now
available in 5 regions all over the world. In this blog post we’ll tell you how
we’ve built it and it should be helpful for anyone working on a globally
distributed SaaS system if latency is a concern.
A bit of history
When our team set out to build a hosted version of Teleport, we had to make
trade-offs to launch a production-grade product quickly. One of these trade-offs
was to deploy Teleport solely in the US West. This allowed us to launch early,
work with our earliest customers t…</span>

Most IT professionals are used to titles and jobs that fit within the developer/programmer world, the security professional, the sysadmin/Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) role, etc. But when you mention Sales Engineering or Pre-Sales Engineering you will often get a blank stare.

Forward-thinking organizations have adopted an omnichannel content strategy, whose mission is to reach audiences across multiple digital channels and platforms.
But how do you set up a content management system (CMS) to reach your audience now and in the future? I learned the hard way that creating a content model—a definition of content types, attributes, and relationships that let people and systems understand content—with my more familiar design-system thinking would capsize my customer’s omnichannel content strategy. You can avoid that outcome by creating content models that are semantic and that also connect related content.…</span>

                    <span>TL;DR - Yes! Bastions are still the recommended solution to manage secure remote access to cloud infrastructures.

There is a growing discussion among network engineers, DevOps teams, and security professionals about the security benefits of bastions. Many assume that they are the “old way” of network access and have little relevance in the modern cloud native stack. These speculations are not irrelevant as in recent years, the corporate IT network perimeter as we knew it is diminishing, and the concept has been shifted to data, identity, and compute perimeter. Software-defined networking solutions have overtaken hardware firewall boxes, and the requirement of managing bare metal servers has shifted to container deployed or even serverless applications.

For the eager, the attack works by pivoting from a Kubernetes worker pod to the node itself, and from there exfiltrating credentials from the CI/CD system. Critically, this vulnerability exposed production AWS credentials that could be used to alter release artifacts and access production infrastructure.
Once discovered, we immediately fixed our CI system to prevent this attack from occurring. Our response team’s analysis found no evidence this vulnerability was exploited or any data was tampered with. Even so, we encoura…</span>

                    <span>What would you do when a security incident is detected? Shut down the servers? Pull out the power cord from the data center? When an incident is detected, both the incident method and the time required to contain an incident are essential to limit the damage. The slower you are to react, the more damage an incident would incur. And a service downtime to contain an incident can cost businesses even more than a security incident itself.
There have been advances in Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platforms and Automated Incident Response tools that offer incident-specific playbooks and response automation tools for easy and systematic incident containment. However, their capabilities depend on containment features and automation API (or CLI tools) offered by infrastruc…</span>

With security threats increasing, much of business continuity has come to rely on data security. In particular, engineering teams building cloud software rely on access to an ever-growing number of computing resources. Security professionals — on their part — view new computing resources as increased attack surface area. The need for security professionals adept at interfacing with engineers and DevOps teams is high, but what does it actually take to become a security expert?

                    <span>Introduction
Can you enumerate every single network socket which can be used to hack into your cloud environment and steal your data?
When counting, are you including the laptops of people who already authenticated and have access? The purpose of opening with this question is not to instill fear. Trying to answer it probably leads to “it’s complicated” and the complexity of access is what this article will cover.
Complexity is our collective enemy in the computing industry. Complex systems are admired, yet they are hard to reason about, hard to secure, and let’s not forget — often unpleasant to use. Below, I will try offering a simple framework for how to think about secure infrastructure access, about its complexity, and a possible solution.

                    <span>What is an HSM?
HSM stands for hardware security module. HSMs are hardware devices. They can be quite small and plugged into the main board of a computer, or they sit side by side in a server rack. They store sensitive data such as private keys. HSMs do not allow you to read that sensitive data back; instead, they expose only cryptographic operations like signing of certificates or encrypting data. This provides stronger protections for storing private keys compared to disks or databases. Even if an attacker gains remote access to a computer system with an HSM, they will not be able to read a private key.
These security benefits are often used in regulatory regimes, like FIPS and PCI for highly sensitive environments.

The intention to make our tech safer is not enough; we need a strategy.
This chapter will equip you with that plan of action. It covers how to integrate safety principles into your design work in order to create tech that’s safe, how to convince your stakeholders that this work is necessary, and how to respond to the critique that what we actually need is more diversity. (Spoiler: we do, but diversity alone is not the antidote to fixing unethical, unsafe tech.)

This summer, I was fortunate enough to get an internship at Teleport. Being part of the co-op program at the University of Waterloo, I have worked at many different companies before, and this internship will be my fourth placement as I finish my first term of the third year. The project that I was assigned to was an interesting one.
For some background, Teleport is an Access Plane that unifies access to SSH servers, Kubernetes clusters, web applications and databases across multiple environments. Teleport provides a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system that allows cluster administrators to allow or deny access to specific cluster resources such as SSH nodes, applications, databases, etc., based on the assigned labels. This system is similar to other cloud-based providers li…</span>

                    <span>Hooks are essential for the functional component pattern in React. One frequent logic comparison with class components was comparing a previous prop value with a current prop value via lifecycle methods. So what’s an easy pattern for duplicating previous value comparisons in functional components? The useRef and useEffect hooks allow us manage that same functionality […]

                    <span>MongoDB users — if you have multiple databases across several computing
environments — this announcement of Teleport 7.0 is for you!
This release comes on the heels of our recent funding news, and reinforces our
goal to empower engineers and security professionals to unify access to
computing resources.
Teleport 7.0
The highlight of this release is the MongoDB support. MongoDB users can now
consolidate access to all of their databases in one place, making it more
convenient but also ensuring industry best practices for secure access. What do
these industry best practices look like? Regardless of the protocol, consider
the following:
Moving away from shared or static credentials to identity-based
authentication using certificates issued daily via SSO with MFA
Moving away from perimeter-base…</span>

                    <span>Teleport, the Access Plane company, is announcing today that it has secured $30M
in Series B funding. The company also released its latest version of its
offering, Teleport 7.0 – introducing identity-based access for MongoDB.
This funding round is led by S28 Capital and Kleiner Perkins and follows the
company’s record-breaking quarter, with net new annual recurring revenue up 5x
and total annual recurring revenue up 2.5x, compared to the second quarter of
2020.
“Since partnering with Teleport at Series A, we have watched them emerge as the
leader in remote infrastructure access, while earning the trust of some of the
largest and most security-conscious companies in the industry”, - said Bucky
Moore, partner at Kleiner Perkins. “This made our decision to double down and

                    <span>With the rise of security threats comes an increased need for strong security measures, but it’s hard to know where to invest your time and money, especially if you’re a small startup. Who should own security when you first get started? Is it worth it to hire a Chief Security Officer (CSO) right away? Is it better to build out an internal security team or hire an external agency instead?
To help answer these questions, Ben Arent, one of our Developer Relations Engineers, sat down with two security experts to get their take. His conversations with Donnie Hasseltine (CSO at Xenon Partner and CEO at TeamPassword) and Luca Carettoni (co-founder of Doyensec) have provided insight into how teams can start building a strong security posture early on, even with limited bandwidth and resources.

Teleport has been instrumental in helping our clients achieve difficult security and compliance requirements, and today we are proud to announce that our Cloud offering is now SOC2 Type II compliant.
Last year our on-premises product was SOC2 Type II certified, and we published an overview on our blog helping explain what SOC2 is and why it has become table stakes for B2B SaaS companies.
In this blog post, we would like to share how Teleport helped us get SOC2 compliant (we use it internally of course) and how you can achieve the same at your organization to make both developers and corporate security professionals happy.
Teleport not only helps make securing access to your servers, Kubernetes clusters, web applications, and databases easier but also makes audits go much smoot…</span>

                    <span>In the 1950s, many in the elite running community had begun to believe it wasn’t possible to run a mile in less than four minutes. Runners had been attempting it since the late 19th century and were beginning to draw the conclusion that the human body simply wasn’t built for the task. 
But on May 6, 1956, Roger Bannister took everyone by surprise. It was a cold, wet day in Oxford, England—conditions no one expected to lend themselves to record-setting—and yet Bannister did just that, running a mile in 3:59.4 and becoming the first person in the record books to run a mile in under four minutes. 
This shift in the benchmark had profound effects; the world now knew that the four-minute mile was possible. Bannister’s record lasted only forty-six days, when it was snatched away by Australian ru…</span>

                    <span>In a Kubernetes cluster, Control Plane controls Nodes, Nodes control Pods, Pods control containers, and containers control applications. But what controls the Control Plane?
Kubernetes exposes APIs that let you configure the entire Kubernetes cluster management lifecycle. Thus, securing access to the Kubernetes API is one of the most security-sensitive aspects to consider when considering Kubernetes security. Even the recently published Kubernetes hardening guide by NSA also suggests to “Use strong authentication and authorization to limit user and administrator access as well as to limit the attack surface” as one of the essential security measures to consider while securing the Kubernetes cluster.

Whether to convey information, conduct transactions, or simply to check in on one another, people have yammered away, chattering and gesticulating, through spoken conversation for countless generations. Only in the last few millennia have we begun to commit our conversations to writing, and only in the last few decades have we begun to outsource them to the computer, a machine that shows much more affinity for written correspondence than for the slangy vagaries of spoken language.
Computers have trouble because between spoken and written language, speech is more primordial. To have successful conversations with us, machines must grapple with the messiness of human speech: the disfluencies and pauses, the gestures and body language, an…</span>

                    <span>Introduction
MongoDB is one of the most popular open-source databases. Unfortunately, this
also means ubiquity of misconfigured and unsecured MongoDB deployments out in
the wild. Just in recent years, we’ve seen several hacks involving thousands
of MongoDB databases left exposed online without any protection, making them
ripe for the hacker’s picking.
It doesn’t have to be this way, though. There are many steps you can take to
keep your MongoDB data safe — from protecting the network perimeter to using
strong transport security to taking advantage of MongoDB’s advanced user
management and role-based access control (RBAC) system.
In this article, we will go over some of the most common ways to securing your
MongoDB cluster.

                    <span>The need for data exfiltration prevention
To keep your business secure, it is important not only to keep the hackers from getting in but also to keep your data from getting out. Even if a malicious actor gains access to the server, for example via an SSH session, it is vital to keep the data from being exfiltrated to an unauthorized location, such as IP addresses not under your organization’s control. In considering a solution to protect against data exfiltration, it is critical to note that one policy does not fit all.
Consider a service invoking webhooks. It will be running with limited data access but must be able to communicate with the entire Internet. Contrast that to an SSH session that’s been opened for troubleshooting purposes.  It will have access to the entire machine but does n…</span>

Flash, Photoshop, and responsive design
When I first started designing websites, my go-to software was Photoshop. I created a 960px canvas and set about creating a layout that I would later drop content in. The development phase was about attaining pixel-perfect accuracy using fixed widths, fixed heights, and absolute positioning.
Ethan Marcotte’s talk at An Event Apart and subsequent article “Responsive Web Design” in A List Apart in 2010 changed all this. I was sold on responsive design as soon as I heard about it, but I was also terrified. The pixel-perfect designs f…</span>

                    <span>This is a guest blog post from Shuo Yang in his blog series “Transitioning to Programming the Cloud”, as a part of our blog posts focusing on Identity, Security and Access.
We talked about how AWS CIP, STS and IAM can serve as the foundation of application authorization in our last post, i.e., how the application gets the temporary credential representing a specific role (i.e. privileges) to access the resources of the applications — an architecture understanding how different building blocks work together under the hood.
Now, we need to strategize how we actually build the authorization mechanism. When talking about application authorizations, we often encounter two concepts RBAC (role-based access control) and ABAC (attribute-based access control).
RBAC: what is it?

                    <span>“Any comment?” is probably one of the worst ways to ask for feedback. It’s vague and open ended, and it doesn’t provide any indication of what we’re looking for. Getting good feedback starts earlier than we might expect: it starts with the request. 
It might seem counterintuitive to start the process of receiving feedback with a question, but that makes sense if we realize that getting feedback can be thought of as a form of design research. In the same way that we wouldn’t do any research without the right questions to get the insights that we need, the best way to ask for feedback is also to craft sharp questions.
Design critique is not a one-shot process. Sure, any good feedback workflow continues until the project is finished, but this is particularly true for design because design wor…</span>

                    <span>MySQL brands itself as the world’s most popular open source database. As popular as MySQL database is among developers and SQL enthusiasts, it is equally popular amongst hackers. Misconfigured server access, overprivileged roles, and weak authentication schemes are the most common security issues in  MySQL database. While access control features provided by MySQL are adequate enough at the SQL level, it is error-prone to manage access at the operational level. This post aims to give you a brief overview of securing access to production MySQL databases.

                    <span>My preference for daily work is usually GUI applications, like Visual Studio Code for text editing and Cyberduck for remote file server management. I’m also a huge fan of automation, so I do try to learn the command line equivalents of UI functions. My latest desire was wanting to know how to upload a file […]

                    <span>Today we are happy to announce that Teleport has been included as a Cool Vendor
in Gartner Cool Vendors in Identity-First Security report.
“We believe Teleport’s inclusion in the Identity-First Security Report by
Gartner is confirmation that Teleport solves a huge problem of accessing
cloud-native resources that traditional PAM tools did not,” said Ev Kontsevoy,
co-founder and CEO of Teleport. “Our approach of leveraging user identity
natively on the protocol level enables us to resolve the inherent conflict
between productivity and security, so both engineers and security professionals
can be happy.”

We talked about IAM in the past 3 posts, identities in IAM, manage users privilege as an IT person and control privilege boundaries:
These are IAM topics that are probably trivial to security professionals, but we hope we gave enough ideas to a small startup which does not have full time security professionals yet.
We also talked about how applications use AWS Cognito Identity Pool to get AWS temporary credentials to access AWS resources in early posts of “What I wish I could have learned before starting using AWS Cognito” and “Authentication and authorization with AWS Amplify under the hood”:

                    <span>Feedback, in whichever form it takes, and whatever it may be called, is one of the most effective soft skills that we have at our disposal to collaboratively get our designs to a better place while growing our own skills and perspectives.
Feedback is also one of the most underestimated tools, and often by assuming that we’re already good at it, we settle, forgetting that it’s a skill that can be trained, grown, and improved. Poor feedback can create confusion in projects, bring down morale, and affect trust and team collaboration over the long term. Quality feedback can be a transformative force. 
Practicing our skills is surely a good way to improve, but the learning gets even faster when it’s paired with a good foundation that channels and focuses the practice. What are some foundational…</span>

We alluded in one of our previous posts that the development team will own a lot of responsibility defining application-related resource access control, simply because the dev team owns the infrastructure as code (IaC) responsibility themselves.
No matter how security-savvy and security-educated a development team is, the central security team still needs some control, some kind of “trust but verify”. In this post, we briefly talk about leveraging the right type of AWS IAM policy mechanisms to build the responsibility separation between the “central” team and the individual “development” team.

Application Access
We’ve made iterative improvements to Application Access. This release focus is on connecting to other applications.
Pass-through header support
We’ve added pass-through header support. Pass-through is a common way of accessing tools and is supported by Splunk, Jenkins, Grafana. This can be configured by rewriting the headers on a per-app basis.

                    <span>Open Source software provides the community source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. OSS is so ubiquitous that it’s even on other planets. This post is for the people who run these projects.
When you think of OSS projects, you might think the requirements are simple. All you need are contributors and a git repository. OSS Projects are seeing increased attacks, from supply chain attacks to account takeovers. Teleport can be used to secure hosted CI/CD systems, protect monitoring dashboards and secure databases, servers and Kubernetes clusters. As contributors come and go, you no longer have to worry about cleaning up access. Teleport integrates with GitHub and GitLab teams to quickly provide access. Once new contributors are added, you can rest assured that all actions are …</span>

Do you feel like your feelings are invisible to the world because you’re experiencing burnout differently? When burnout starts to push down on us, our core comes through more. Beautiful, peaceful souls get quieter and fade into that distant and distracted burnout we’ve all read about. But some of us, those with fires always burning on the edges of our core, get hotter. In my heart I am fire. When I face burnout I double down, triple down, burning hotter and hotter to try to best the challenge. I don’t fade—I am engulfed in a zealous burnout. 
So what on earth is a zealous burnout?

                    <span>Introduction
Making frequent changes to cloud applications running in production is the
de-facto standard. To minimize errors, engineers use CI/CD automation,
techniques like code reviews, green-blue deployments and others.
Git pull requests often serve as a foundational component for triggering code
reviews, Slack notifications, and subsequent automation such as testing and
deployments. This automated process enforces peer reviews and creates enough
visibility to minimize human error. Pull requests work quite well.
But what happens when a production PostgreSQL database, some SSH nodes, or a
certain Kubernetes cluster needs troubleshooting? Unfortunately, quite often an
engineer will just access those resources using a shared credential, without a
formalized approval process, increasing po…</span>

                    <span>This year we launched Teleport Cloud, a new service for providing a hosted version of Teleport Access Plane. One of the first problems the team had to tackle was how to secure the new infrastructure properly, and the team wanted to ensure the best possible results by engaging in an independent audit.
As with the Teleport core product, we engaged with Doyensec to provide an independent security audit of our production environment. At Teleport, we believe independent auditors offer the best insight into where we are weak. In addition, Doyensec has demonstrated that their teams’ skill and attention to detail in attacking our infrastructure are unmatched.
The audit occurred between January 11th and January 29th before we officially launched to customers in March. Therefore, some of the finding…</span>

                    <span>This Person Does Not Exist is a website that generates human faces with a machine learning algorithm. It takes real portraits and recombines them into fake human faces. We recently scrolled past a LinkedIn post stating that this website could be useful “if you are developing a persona and looking for a photo.” 
We agree: the computer-generated faces could be a great match for personas—but not for the reason you might think. Ironically, the website highlights the core issue of this very common design method: the person(a) does not exist. Like the pictures, personas are artificially made. Information is taken out of natural context and recombined into an isolated snapshot that’s detached from reality. 
But strangely enough, designers use personas to inspire their design for the real world.

                    <span>The need for cross-origin web sessions
Writing a web application that supports securely logging into a website and
managing your credentials is a surprisingly difficult task. You have to develop
a way to manage sessions, understand how browsers store state (cookies), learn
a cryptographically safe password storing technique (like bcrypt), all the
while making sure you mitigate common web security vulnerabilities like
XSS and
CSRF.
Even after you’ve implemented all of the above, you’ll still only be logged
into a single application at a single domain, like example.org.
What if you are running multiple applications under different domains and you
want to transfer your session state to another domain, like example.com or
acme.com, how do you implement it in a simple and secure way?

We’re transitioning to a new world of remote work and digital content. We’re also experimenting with unprecedented content channels that, not too long ago, elicited chuckles at the watercooler, like voice interfaces, digital signage, augmented reality, and virtual reality.
Many factors are responsible. Perhaps it’s because we yearn for immersive spaces that temporarily resurrect the Before Times, or maybe it’s due to the boredom and tedium of our now-cemented stuck-at-home routines.

Your website is a good place to introduce your product or service outside your locale. Localizing your web content sounds like the right way to reach out to the global market. Localization will bridge the language barriers, or the wider scope of differing cultures. 
Before we move on further with the discussion, let’s focus on the definition of “localization.” 
What is localization?
According to the Cambridge Dictionary, localization (as a marketing term) is “the process of making a product or service more suitable for a particular country, area, etc.,” while translation is “something that is translated, or the process of translating something, from one language to…</span>

                    <span>Teleport has supported multi-factor authentication (MFA) for a while now, via
Authenticator Apps (TOTP) and Hardware Tokens (U2F) such as YubiKeys. But this
support was pretty limited: you could only choose one MFA protocol and users
could only register one device. If a user lost their device, they would be
locked out and need an account reset by the administrator.
So, for Teleport 6.0, we’ve reimplemented the MFA support to make it more
flexible. You can now enable both TOTP and U2F, and each user can have as many
devices registered as they please. If you lose your U2F key but still have a
TOTP app registered, you can log back in and replace your lost U2F key. No need
to nag the cluster admin.
While working on this, I had the pleasure of learning about this exciting world
of hardware MFA …</span>

What is SAML 2.0?
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 is one of the most widely used open standard for authentication and authorizing between multiple parties. It’s one of the protocol that give users the single sign-on (SSO) experience for applications. The other adopted open standard is OAuth and OpenID. Of the two, SAML 2.0, released in 2005, remains the 800 pound gorilla in Enterprise SSO space. This post provides a detailed introduction on how SAML works

What’s worse than an unsafe private key? An unsafe public key.
The “secure” in secure shell comes from the combination of hashing, symmetric encryption, and asymmetric encryption. Together, SSH uses cryptographic primitives to safely connect clients and servers. In the 25 years since its founding, computing power and speeds in accordance with Moore’s Law have necessitated increasingly complicated low-level algorithms. This article will focus on asymmetric keygen algorithms.
As of 2020, the most widely adopted algorithms are RSA, DSA, ECDSA, and EdDSA, but it is RSA and EdDSA that provide the best security and performance.

                    <span>Introduction
Databases are the Holy Grail for hackers, and as such, must be protected
with utmost care. This is the first in a series of articles in which we’ll give
an overview of best practices for securing your databases. We’re starting with
one of the most popular open-source databases, PostgreSQL, and will go over
several levels of security you’d need to think about:
Network-level security
Transport-level security
Database-level security
Network-Level Security for PostgreSQL
Firewalls
In the ideal world, your PostgreSQL server would be completely isolated and not
allow any inbound connections, SSH or psql. Unfortunately, this sort of
air-gapped setup is not something PostgreSQL supports out-of-the-box.

Introduction
In this blog post we’ll cover how to set up an SSH jump server. We’ll cover two open source projects.
A traditional SSH jump server using OpenSSH. The advantage of this method is that your servers already have OpenSSH pre-installed.
A modern approach using Teleport, a newer open source alternative to OpenSSH.
Both of these servers are easy to install and configure, are free and open-source, and are single-binary Linux daemons.
What is an SSH Jump Server?
An SSH jump server is a regular Linux server, accessible from the Internet, which is used as a gateway to access other Linux machines on a private network using the SSH protocol. Sometimes an SSH jump server is also called a “jump host” or a “bastion host”. The purpose of an SS…</span>

                    <span>Everyone wants to be an expert. But what does that even mean? Over the years I’ve seen two types of people who are referred to as “experts.” Expert 1 is someone who knows every tool in the language and makes sure to use every bit of it, whether it helps or not. Expert 2 also knows every piece of syntax, but they’re pickier about what they employ to solve problems, considering a number of factors, both code-related and not. 
Can you take a guess at which expert we want working on our team? If you said Expert 2, you’d be right. They’re a developer focused on delivering readable code—lines of JavaScript others can understand and maintain. Someone who can make the complex simple. But “readable” is rarely definitive—in fact, it’s largely based on the eyes of the beholder. So where does that lea…</span>

                    <span>Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is an attack that can be used to make your application issue arbitrary HTTP requests. SSRF is used by attackers to proxy requests from services exposed on the internet to un-exposed internal endpoints. SSRF is a hacker reverse proxy. These arbitrary requests often target internal network endpoints to perform anything from reconnaissance to complete account takeover. SSRF, along with XSS and CSRF, are some of the most serious web security vulnerabilities due to pervasiveness and impact.
What is SSRF?
Upon first glance, adding the ability to issue a HTTP request from your application does not appear to be the type of feature that would require a security review. However, any time you allow a user to control the target of an HTTP request, an attacker can use…</span>

                    <span>What is a CSRF Attack?
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks allow an attacker to forge and submit
requests as a logged-in user to a web application. CSRF exploits the fact that
HTML elements send ambient credentials (like cookies) with requests, even
cross-origin.
Like XSS, to launch a CSRF attack the attacker has to convince the victim to
either click on or navigate to a link. Unlike XSS, CSRF only allows an attacker
to make requests to the victim’s origin and does not give the attacker code
execution within that origin. This does not mean CSRF attacks are any less
important to defend against. As we’ll see in the examples, CSRF can be as
dangerous as XSS.
Background of CSRF
The web originated as a platform to view static documents. Interactivity was

                    <span>The Service Worker API is the Dremel of the web platform. It offers incredibly broad utility while also yielding resiliency and better performance. If you’ve not used Service Worker yet—and you couldn’t be blamed if so, as it hasn’t seen wide adoption as of 2020—it goes something like this:
On the initial visit to a website, the browser registers what amounts to a client-side proxy powered by a comparably paltry amount of JavaScript that—like a Web Worker—runs on its own thread.
After the Service Worker’s registration, you can intercept requests and decide how to respond to them in the Service Worker’s fetch() event.




What you decide to do with requests you intercept is a) your call and b) depends on your website. You can rewrite requests, precache static assets during install, provide …</span>

List and see all database instances running somewhere behind NAT, including
AWS RDS or Aurora.
Get instant access to them using CLI tools like psql, mysql, or Web UIs.
Meanwhile, Teleport ensures industry best practices for:
Consolidating management of access requests
Implementing role-based access controls
Preventing data exfiltration
Improving visibility into user behavior

— African Proverb
Since March 2020, most of us have been working from home, and the days blend into each other and look the same. This is not the first time I have experienced this type of feeling. 
My commute — New York to New Jersey — is what folks in my area call the reverse commute.While going to the office, my days began to look the same: riding the subway to a bus to a shuttle to get to my job. Have you ever arrived at a destination and not even realized how you got there? This is how I began to experience the world everyday. I stopped paying attention to my surroundings.
Because I worked a lot, the only time I would take off was for the holidays. During this time, I was a consultant and was coming to the end of an existing contract. For six years stra…</span>

Amazon’s AWS Systems Manager, better known as SSM to long-time AWS users, was announced at the end of 2017, replacing the similarly named EC2 Systems Manager that had launched a year prior. Similar to other AWS products, System Manager provides a broad spectrum of features instead of a focused and opinionated product.
SSM’s capabilities revolve around managing bare operating-system level details that would otherwise be inaccessible from Amazon’s ever-expanding and all-encompassing aws CLI and API control plane layer. It has grown into having its own dedicated interface within the Amazon AWS console and its underlying system-level agent has been released under an open source software license on Github.

Every cloud has its own identity and access management system. AWS and Google use a bunch
of JSON files specifying various rules. Open source projects like Kubernetes support
three concurrent access control models - attribute-based, role-based and
a webhook access control, all expressed using YAML. Some teams are going as far as
inventing their own programming language to solve this evergreen problem.
As many engineers before us, we faced the challenge of choosing the
design and the tooling from the kaleidoscope of JSON, YAML and custom languages
for our own software’s access controls. Which system is the best, and can there be one language to rule them all?
What are the properties of a good access control system, and what mistakes of the past should we avoid?

                    <span>The future of web-based software architectures is already taking form, and this time it’s server-rendered (again). Papa’s got a brand new bag: HTML-over-WebSockets and broadcast everything all the time.
The dual approach of marrying a Single Page App with an API service has left many dev teams mired in endless JSON wrangling and state discrepancy bugs across two layers. This costs dev time, slows release cycles, and saps the bandwidth for innovation.
But a new WebSockets-driven approach is catching web developers’ attention. One that reaffirms the promises of classic server-rendered frameworks: fast prototyping, server-side state management, solid rendering performance, rapid feature development, and straightforward SEO. One that enables multi-user collaboration and reactive, responsive de…</span>

                    <span>What is an XSS Attack?
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is an attack that allows JavaScript from one site to
run on another. XSS is interesting not due to the technical difficulty of the
attack but rather because it exploits some of the core security mechanisms of
web browsers and because of its sheer pervasiveness. Understanding XSS and its
mitigations provides substantial insight into how the web works and how sites
are safely (and unsafely) isolated from each other.
Background of XSS Attacks
Initially the web was a collection of static HTML documents that the browser would render for users to view. As the web grew, demands for richer documents grew, which led to the development of JavaScript and cookies: JavaScript to make documents interactive and cookies to allow browsers to save the state …</span>

                    <span>In the 1920s, Robert Moses designed a system of parkways surrounding New York City. His designs, which included overpasses too low for public buses, have become an often-cited example of exclusionary design and are argued by biographer Robert A. Caro to represent a purposeful barrier between the city’s Black and Puerto Rican residents and nearby beaches. 
Regardless of the details of Moses’s parkway project, it’s a particularly memorable reminder of the political power of design and the ways that choices can exclude various groups based on abilities and resources. The growing interest in inclusive design highlights questions of who can participate, and in relation to the web, this has often meant a focus on accessibility and user experience, as well as on questions related to team diversit…</span>

                    <span>SSH Access Hardening
SSH certificates, when deployed properly, improve security.
A half-baked access system using certs is more vulnerable than a public-key-based one if a user or host gets hacked.
SSH is hard. Our team learned this at Rackspace, a large managed hosting and cloud provider.
We started with deploying public keys to every server. We added a jump server with a second factor login to prevent
hacks using stolen keys. Soon, infosec team asked us to log into a web portal to match SSH logins with emails.
Evolution does not produce the most efficient result, and our system did not turn out great either.
We were missing keys on some servers and found stale keys on others.
No one liked login screens popping up multiple times a day.
We received only one one-time password token, and som…</span>

                    <span>I’m willing to bet that you probably didn’t start your web career because you wanted to be a politician or a salesperson. But here’s the cold, hard truth, friend: if you want to work on design systems, you don’t have a choice. Someone has to pay for your time, and that means someone has to sell what you do to an audience that speaks value in an entirely different language. 
It’s not exactly easy to connect the benefits of a design system directly to revenue. With an ecomm site, you can add a feature and measure the impact. With other conversion-based digital experiences, if your work is good, your customers will convert more. But because a design system is (usually) an internal tool, it’s just harder to connect those dots.

                    <span>It seems like nowadays, every company is a SaaS company. We’ve even begun stratifying by what is sold, replacing the “software” in SaaS to whatever the product’s core competency is, search-as-a-service, chat-as-a-service, video-as-a-service. So, when we, at Teleport, set sail for the cloud after years of successfully navigating on-prem software, we came in with a different set of experiences.
Turns out, porting a tool designed to be self-hosted to something hosted isn’t as simple as pulling our build image from quay.io. Well, in a way it is, but what I mean is that the SaaS route poses a different series of design challenges than on-prem. The product is the same, but not how users interface with it.
