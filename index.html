                    <span>As software and hardware engineers around the world are untangling the centralization of the internet, a vocal portion within the enclave of blockchain-based solutions - generally referred to as decentralized finance - or DeFi for short - has emerged. While blockchains provide the building blocks for reliable information and - to a lesser extend value - transport functions  - a layer of middleware to the larger concept of cryptographic primitives mapped by protocols, current developments are largely focused on digitally native assets, and their derivatives. However, a first-principles view on the innovation of financial services will focus on the central tenet of technology: the increase of productivity of human activity, freeing up individuals’ attention — measured in time — that these can assign to leisure activities or higher-order pursuits, such as the accumulation of knowledge. To that end, network technologies, in particular, the internet and consequent emergence of the World Wide Web, amplified human productivity by fueling a surge of synchronous and asynchronous coordination methods of human fecundity, as well as the wider distribution of economic activity in general.</span>

Polygon PoS chain is a hybrid between a sidechain and a Layer 2. It recently passed the milestone of having more daily active addresses than Ethereum! I personally see Polygon as the future of scaling because Ethereum’s proof of stake will not solve scaling issues, and that Ethereum 2.0 will not make the platform infinitely scalable. Instead it will continue to have a limited capacity and will require layer two solutions like Polygon.</span>

A very similar task called image captioning may sound really simple but is, in fact, just as complex. It is the ability of a machine to generate a natural description of an image.</span>

We are familiar with flash loan attacks that use uncollateralised loans across a multitude of protocols to manipulate certain markets and pump-and-dump certain assets. We also know about reentrancy attacks that exploit the logic of execution of functions inside a smart contract. However, the Badger DAO exploit was both more and less ingenious at once.</span>

And in the classical understanding of Python, in 90% of cases, CPython is meant. It is a reference implementation of the interpreter under the guidance of Guido van Rossum. Version 3.10 is current as of November 14, 2021. By now, Python means only version 3, but before this version appeared, mentions of version 2 can still be found. Now version 2 is not supported and most companies are removing the remnants of the code from version 2. by porting the code to version 3. As of January 1, 2020, Python 2 is no longer supported [https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/]. And this is quite understandable since, after the release of Python 3 in 2006, developers had to support 2 versions at the same time, which is laborious.</span>

Many of them can be called not mistakes, but behavioral features, stages all beginners go through. We as Java course creators are interested in this topic, so we interviewed opinion leaders and collected the most common, in their view, examples of such behavioral errors in order to … shorten their duration for future software developers. If you start noticing such behavioral mistakes early and try to fix them, your path to mastery will be shorter and your work will be more efficient.</span>

But they are a fact of life when you&#x27;re working with Git, especially when you&#x27;re teaming up with other developers. In most cases, merge conflicts aren&#x27;t as scary as you might think. In this fourth part of our “Advanced Git” series we&#x27;ll talk about when they can happen, what they actually are, and how to solve them.
