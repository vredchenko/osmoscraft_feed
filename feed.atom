These resources can be files, programs, web applications, mobile applications, operating systems, network devices, etc. Let’s explore three common scenarios on how authentication and authorization are involved.
Accessing a web application. Signing in to a web application using a username and password combination or single sign-on (SSO) involves authentication. But the ability to view certain web pages and update application data is subjected to authorization.

        <updated>2022-02-09T23:39:16.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tailwindcss-autocomplete
This package uses the great work of raybrownco/atom-tailwindcss and vinkla/autocomplete-tailwind. Unfortunately, both projects are stuck at Tailwind CSS v1 and there does not seem to be any activity in both repositories.
This project is updated to include the classnames of Tailwind CSS v2.2.19 and has been fixed to show a preview of the color names.
Manually Installing this Atom Package
git clone https://github.com/toddy15/tailwindcss-autocomplete.git
cd tailwindcss-autocomplete
npm install
npm run build
apm install
apm link .



Creating a New Release
The following process should be followed to create a new release of this package. (I'm writing these words just as much for myself as I am for anyone interested in sending a PR.)
# If the project's not set up yet:
git clone https://github.com/toddy15/tailwindcss-autocomplete.git
cd tailwindcss-autocomplete
npm install
 
# Grab the latest version of Tailwind CSS
npm update tailwindcss
 
# Run a script to update the `src/completions.json` file
npm run build
 
# Run tests to make sure the update hasn't broken anything
npm run test
 
# Perform a manual visual inspection of the completions
git diff src/completions.json


If nothing has failed and the inspection goes well enough, you're ready to create a new version! All this means is that you crack open package.json and bump the version number. After that's done, send a pull request!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At Teleport, we advocate SSH certificates over SSH keys and passwords as the best authentication method for SSH. Nothing beats the security and operational flexibility of using certificate-based authentication for a large fleet of SSH servers running on dynamic infrastructure. But in practice, certificate-based authentication is far from the de facto authentication method, and sometimes we may need to use SSH keys. For example, in my daily workflow I use SSH keys when accessing DigitalOcean servers or to check repositories in my GitHub personal account because SSH keys are the default available methods (alongside passwords). So it helps to learn the best way to generate and use SSH keys.

We’ll focus on changing the default SSH port and implementing SSH port knocking to make it more difficult for unwanted users to discover or locate the server. This is a technique known as security through obscurity and is fun to implement but it is not wildly practiced as it does not play well with automated SSH access and adds operational complexity of implementation if you have multiple SSH servers.
To follow this tutorial, you need:
A Linux OS with OpenSSH server. This is the server you want to hide. You will need SSH access to this server with a sudo privilege to perform configurations shown in this post.
A local machine to access the SSH server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Xentu Lua Snippets for Atom
This extension provides code snippets for the Xentu game engine for use in Atom.
Supports keywords, properties, functions, and also constants for things like Keyboard & Mouse.
Some features are not yet added, such as class properties and functions, these will be provided soon. For now now refer to the documentation if you get stuck, found at https://docs.xentu.net
This package is part of the Xentu game engine project: https://xentu.net

Running a Xentu game from Atom
If you have the Xentu SDK installed, you can enhance your coding experience by
adding a few shortcuts to your Atom editor. Here is a script that can be added
under File -> Init Script... that allows you to launch a game from within the
editor:
# adds a function to allow running a Xentu game within Atom.
spawn = require('child_process').spawn
atom.commands.add 'atom-text-editor', 'xentu-play', ->
	file = atom.workspace.getActiveTextEditor().getPath()
	dir = atom.project.getDirectoryForProjectPath(file).path
	proc = spawn('xentusdk', ['play'], { cwd: dir })
	proc.stdout.on "data", (uint8array) ->
		data = new TextDecoder().decode(uint8array)
		console.log data
	proc.stdout.on "close", () ->
		console.log "Game Ended"


Once you've added the code above, restart Atom, then when you are editing your game.lua file, use CTRL+SHIFT+P and type "Xentu Play" to launch your game. Optionally also use CTRL+SHIFT+I to show the Atom developer console also before running the play command to see the console output.
Happy coding!]]></summary>

This is a starter template for creating an Atom UI theme.
This template only includes the minimum of styling needed and comes with a neutral look. It could already be used as a real theme, but its purpose is to serve as a basis for creating your own theme. It is documented throughout and invites you to make changes to your liking. For some inspiration take a look at other Atom themes at atom.io/themes. Or you're always free to fork a theme that already comes close to your vision.
Happy theming! 🚀

The project had an input field where you could type in the name of an anime to search for. The text typed in the input field was then used to query the API for animes matching the input. The input field was to use “instant search” mechanism. This meant that users where not required to hit enter or press a button for the search to occur. To prevent making a call to the API on every keystroke, I had to debounce the queries made to the API.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Auto Sass
Package for the Atom IDE that takes a Sass file on each save and automatically compiles, lints, prefixes, and saves the resulting CSS code.
Overview
This plugin was something I developed rather quickly and primarily with my own use in mind. I wouldn't expect that others would find it any more useful than the myriad Sass compiler packages already out there.
Motivation to publicize and provide this brief explainer is mostly to make it easier for me when I eventually have to come back to debug something. Perhaps others might find it useful as well though.
Features
Uses latest Dart Sass Node API
Lints and fixes compiled CSS with Stylelint using nearest .stylintrc config available
Runs Autoprefixer on compiled CSS

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Robotic process automation (RPA) projects are a challenging endeavor. According to a recent survey, 69% of RPA projects fail to take off because of their complexity. And for the lucky ones that manage to proceed to execution, up to 50% of them fail. To further complicate matters, Blueprint, an enterprise automation company, reports that 63% of business leaders are not satisfied with their RPA implementation speed. PwC’s study supports this idea. The consultancy found that conducting an RPA proof of concept or a pilot project often takes 4-6 months instead of the expected 4-6 weeks.However, if companies take on their automation projects prepared and aware of the possible RPA challenges, they can reap great rewards. Many are already benefiting from workflow automation services as the global RPA market increases in value. The Grand View Research forecasts this market to hit $13.74 billion by 2028, growing at a CAGR of 32.8% from 2020.Also, COVID-19 vastly accelerated automation, despite the pitfalls of RPA deployment. To highlight the significant role of the pandemic, Mihir Shukla, Co-founder and CEO of Automation Anywhere, gave the following example: at one point during the pandemic, a large bank was forced to update six million loan records immediately. Without RPA, such an enormous task would take two years to accomplish.So, why do RPA projects fail? And how to succeed despite the discouraging stats above?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The SSH agent (ssh-agent) is an SSH key manager that stores the SSH key in a process memory so that users can log into SSH servers without having to type the key’s passphrase every time they authenticate with the server.

With consumers being quick to change their preferences and behaviors, microservices adopters are able to keep up. Life is now great, they say.As much as 56% of companies participating in a recent IMB survey plan to adopt a microservices approach in the next 24 months. Almost 80% of current users say their business will likely step up investment in microservices.Microservices advantages have prompted Netflix, Amazon, eBay, Twitter, and many other tech giants to migrate from monolithic to microservices architecture.But should your company use microservices?It depends on the context and if microservices pros outweigh the cons for your application.This blog provides an overview of a microservices vs. monolithic approach and five key benefits of using a microservices architecture.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I talk to a lot of engineers every day. SREs. Systems Architects. Security Engineers. What I am hearing from them is that they are moving away from passwords — both in their personal lives, opting for more secure forms of authentication like biometrics and second factors, and at work. It just doesn’t make sense anymore to protect your personal bank with a second factor, but to share around an SSH key to access critical server infrastructure.
Passwords are still the leading way to grant access to infrastructure, even though stolen or hacked credentials are the number one cause of data breaches.

But this is changing. Look at the 32% of respondents in our recent The State of Infrastructure Access & Security Report 2021. We surveyed 1000 IT, DevOps and Security professionals to find out what they were thinking about some of the most important security issues at the moment.
Short-lived identity-based certificates are a small part of the overall security toolkit today, but they are rightly seen as superior to SSH keys and other shared credentials that are just passwords by another name.
When asked why they had implemented certificates, people said that they were more secure, more feature-rich, and limited the attack surface in time.

All of this is why 77% of companies view moving towards a passwordless infrastructure as “very important” or “important”. In case you are wondering, they are also adopting zero-trust networks (86%) and just-in-time infrastructure access (89%).
Are you currently implementing passwordless access for your infrastructure? If so, we’d love to help. Reach out and one of our expert solution engineers will help you architect the solution in a way that is not only more secure, but also more agile.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As software and hardware engineers around the world are untangling the centralization of the internet, a vocal portion within the enclave of blockchain-based solutions - generally referred to as decentralized finance - or DeFi for short - has emerged. While blockchains provide the building blocks for reliable information and - to a lesser extend value - transport functions  - a layer of middleware to the larger concept of cryptographic primitives mapped by protocols, current developments are largely focused on digitally native assets, and their derivatives. However, a first-principles view on the innovation of financial services will focus on the central tenet of technology: the increase of productivity of human activity, freeing up individuals’ attention — measured in time — that these can assign to leisure activities or higher-order pursuits, such as the accumulation of knowledge. To that end, network technologies, in particular, the internet and consequent emergence of the World Wide Web, amplified human productivity by fueling a surge of synchronous and asynchronous coordination methods of human fecundity, as well as the wider distribution of economic activity in general.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background video player / manager for Atom
*** ALPHA VERSION (Not really public ready) ***
*** ESPECIALLY BAD WINDOWS SUPPORT FOR NOW :P ***
Usage
Play videos in background
recommended
use Real_ESRGAN to improve quality of images (not implemented yet)
use thunar script for image_created_by_thunar.jpg and folders "images_created_by_thunar"... (not public yet)
Todo :
shadowRoot bug after inactivity / suspend ?
SOME THEMES PUT COLOR ABOVE BACKGROUND IMAGE (Nord Atom for example)... :(
(Need to edit theme manually, cannot find JS or CSSthat works with !important... - .item-views)
images : not use image if (height > width)
include audio player ?? (use video with displaying,playing audio only ?)
disable video but keep playing audio on focus change, instead of pausing
allow previous video (add button too)
disable / enable line-numbers background color ???
disable / enable dim background
allow to add an unlimited amount of RV / RVL / RI... in settings
range of background opacity in settings
Add button for Real_ESRGAN
ctrl + alt + m : next image ???
transfer to/from mpv player
XTRA (Not directly related to background-video-player but to Atom in general on my personal configuration)
1 - I want to switch displayCodeHighlights on text selection, to see it better on the minimap,
Need to change 2 functions in the "highlight-selected" plugin :
search-model.js :
static makeClasses() { atom.config.set('minimap.displayCodeHighlights', 'false');
selection-manager.js :
removeAllMarkers() { atom.config.set('minimap.displayCodeHighlights', 'true');
2 - Refresh the css right position of wallpaper to avoid minimap by changing "tree-view-autoresize" plugin :
On hide/show tree-view, the background wallpaper goes under the minimap plugin...
tree-view-autoresize.coffee :
resizeTreeView: -> setTimeout => if(atom.config.get('background-video-player.underMinimap')==false) document.querySelectorAll(".item-views")[1].style.backgroundPosition="top 0px right " + document.getElementsByTagName('atom-text-editor-minimap')[0].width + "px";]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[python-virtualenv
Automatic Python .venv activation in current project
When current text editor changes, package searches for .venv/bin/activate file, sources it and modifies PATH for the Atom process.
Currently only .venv is supported, since it's most widely used name for in-project virtualenv and many tools use it, such as Poetry.
You can not deactivate virtualenv, but please open an issue if this is an essential feature.
You can see which project's virtualenv is currently active in the status bar at the bottom.
NOTE: There are one caveat that you can notice: there may be virtualenv and editor mismatch on Atom startup if files from different projects was opened at editor shutdown.
This is because there are packages, such as ide-python, that execute their logic for each opened editor and require virtualenv for each of them in order to spawn matching python-language-server, but lack the discovery. For example, if you don't have python-language-server installed globally (only within project's .venv), this .venv must be activated when ide-python attempts to spawn it. And if I ensure that current project is processed last by this package, ide-python will use it's python-language-server (if it's installed) for any other python files from any project that currently have text editor opened.
AFAIK opened editors processing order is undefined, so I can not be sure that .venv used by ide-python right now and project for one particular opened file match. Only solution is on ide-python side - implement .venv discovery on their own.]]></summary>

Those traditional ones are aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities in the code of smart contracts of the protocols, otherwise called bugs. We are familiar with flash loan attacks that use uncollateralised loans across a multitude of protocols to manipulate certain markets and pump-and-dump certain assets. We also know about reentrancy attacks that exploit the logic of execution of functions inside a smart contract. However, the Badger DAO exploit was both more and less ingenious at once.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[export-project-html (Atom Package)
A plugin for the Atom text editor that exports the currently open code project to a static website, in a new folder called WebPublish in the project's root directroy. All code files are exported to html so that when opened in a browser the code is formatted like it would be in Atom, and markdown files are rendered into rich text too.
export-html package by nubohito (for converting code files to html) and Atom's built-in markdown-preview package for converting markdown files to html, many thanks to the developers of those packages.
Usage:
In Atom, press Ctrl+Shift+P and then search for "export-project-html" ("xpro" will do). Then press enter, and your project will be converted to html in a folder called WebPublish.

Issues:
When using fenced or tabbed codeblocks without a specified language, the plugin crashes. This is a known issue in the markdown-preview package, whose code is used in this package.
A workaround is to specify a language for the code block:
For example, in your markdown, don't do:
    Hello world example:
    ```
    import os
    print("Hello World!")
    ```


Instead:
    Hello world example:
    ```python
    import os
    print("Hello World!")
    ```


Don't do:
Hello world example:
    import os
    print("Hello World!")


Instead:
Hello world example:
    ```python
    import os
    print("Hello World!")

A very preliminary version of syntax highlighting for the cognitive modeling language ACT-R.
Some keywords are recognized (e.g. ISA, chunk-type) and buffer-names are treated like functions.
Code folding works (thanks to the code already written for 'normal' lisp).
Files with the extension ".lisp" are recognized and highlighted accordingly.
I copied the stuff in grammars/actr.cson mostly from a github page on lisp syntax highlighting here:
https://github.com/enriquefernandez/language-lisp
Edit the file grammars/actr.cson if you want to add some patterns to be highlighted or change existing ones.
There is a snippet now, too. Starting to type "production" should open a suggestion on your cursor called production, if you hit enter it will write the structure for a new production.
You can fill it out using tab to go from place to place to complete.
Add or change here: snippets/language-actr.cson
This is how it looks like:]]></summary>

Initially a blend between Monokai and One Dark, Mechanicus is a camouflage looking color scheme with slightly higher contrast.
The theme works as intended for the following languages: PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Python (as of 4.1.0)
HTML

CSS

JavaScript


PHP

Python

Roadmap
Since I primarily built this theme for myself, the last language I would like to properly colour is C/C++. With the theme as it is, the support is nearly ready, but it is not yet consistent with the other languages. If I decide to move to a new language, I might add consistent colouring for it as well.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Customers are increasingly looking for just-in-time access to infrastructure. Imagine there is a production outage and a senior SRE needs to login to a production server to diagnose and fix the issue. In this organization, on-call SREs have elevated access to production systems, but when they are off-duty, their privileges are reduced. When the Pager Duty alert goes off, our on-call SRE ssh’s into the server but after several minutes of looking, can’t diagnose the issue. But she thinks a colleague might be able to. The colleague who she wants to help isn’t on call, so doesn’t have SSH access to the box.  Not a problem, she can use Teleport to request temporary elevated access through PagerDuty, Jira or another system which is then approved via the on-call SRE or other required approver and…]]></summary>

This atom plugin highlights the syntax and spell mistakes in your editor.

Features:
Highlight mistakes
Suggest replacing text
Highlight only text in specific scopes (see here)
By default,  highlight correctly latex files and comments in other languages
LaTeX
It's advised to separate different blocks (paragraph, section, ...) with new lines to reduce the number of mistakes not
highlighted.
Correcter modules
There is 2 modules implemented:
ginger that work online (using gingerbread library)
languagetool that can work online and offline and support more than 20 languages. Due to the big amount of
requests, it's recommended to have a local server.
Languagetool support
If you use a local languagetool server (see here to install your own),
you can give in option a command line that will be executed when the package is activated to try to start the server.
You can add in package option Language Tool Stop Server Command a command that shut down the server when the package is disabled.
Scopes
In the parameters, there are 2 fields (Excluded Scopes and Included Scopes)for the scopes' management. Both are list
of atom scopes and will be use as regex. To be highlighted, a text must be matched by at least one regex in the
Included Scopes list and none of the Excluded Scopes list.
By default, the package is configured to highlight correctly latex files and comments in other languages.

And this is just a small set of what’s possible with SSH.
In this post, I’ll cover different tunneling features as supported by OpenSSH, which helps achieve security use cases such as remote web service access without exposing ports on the internet, accessing servers behind NAT, exposing local ports to the internet. OpenSSH is the most widely used open-source SSH server. It comes pre-installed by default with the vast majority of Linux distributions.

As the IT Director at Teleport, I help review every vendor decision. As we have transitioned from a scrappy open source startup to a hyper-growth SaaS company, our priorities have started to shift from quickly deploying lots of free open source software ourselves to buying robust SaaS software to keep our agility and deal with ever-growing scalability, security and compliance burdens.

A multi-protocol access proxy is a powerful concept for securing access to
infrastructure. But accessing numerous computing resources distributed across
the globe via a single endpoint presents a latency challenge.
Today we are announcing that the hosted edition of Teleport Access Plane is now
available in 5 regions all over the world. In this blog post we’ll tell you how
we’ve built it and it should be helpful for anyone working on a globally
distributed SaaS system if latency is a concern.
A bit of history
When our team set out to build a hosted version of Teleport, we had to make
trade-offs to launch a production-grade product quickly. One of these trade-offs
was to deploy Teleport solely in the US West. This allowed us to launch early,

But how do you set up a content management system (CMS) to reach your audience now and in the future? I learned the hard way that creating a content model—a definition of content types, attributes, and relationships that let people and systems understand content—with my more familiar design-system thinking would capsize my customer’s omnichannel content strategy.

There is a growing discussion among network engineers, DevOps teams, and security professionals about the security benefits of bastions. Many assume that they are the “old way” of network access and have little relevance in the modern cloud native stack. These speculations are not irrelevant as in recent years, the corporate IT network perimeter as we knew it is diminishing, and the concept has been shifted to data, identity, and compute perimeter. Software-defined networking solutions have overtaken hardware firewall boxes, and the requirement of managing bare metal servers has shifted to container deployed or even serverless applications.

Complexity is our collective enemy in the computing industry. Complex systems are admired, yet they are hard to reason about, hard to secure, and let’s not forget — often unpleasant to use.

HSM stands for hardware security module. HSMs are hardware devices. They can be quite small and plugged into the main board of a computer, or they sit side by side in a server rack. They store sensitive data such as private keys. HSMs do not allow you to read that sensitive data back; instead, they expose only cryptographic operations like signing of certificates or encrypting data. This provides stronger protections for storing private keys compared to disks or databases. Even if an attacker gains remote access to a computer system with an HSM, they will not be able to read a private key.
These security benefits are often used in regulatory regimes, like FIPS and PCI for highly sensitive environments.

Who should own security when you first get started? Is it worth it to hire a Chief Security Officer (CSO) right away? Is it better to build out an internal security team or hire an external agency instead?
To help answer these questions, Ben Arent, one of our Developer Relations Engineers, sat down with two security experts to get their take. His conversations with Donnie Hasseltine (CSO at Xenon Partner and CEO at TeamPassword) and Luca Carettoni (co-founder of Doyensec) have provided insight into how teams can start building a strong security posture early on, even with limited bandwidth and resources.

But on May 6, 1956, Roger Bannister took everyone by surprise. It was a cold, wet day in Oxford, England—conditions no one expected to lend themselves to record-setting—and yet Bannister did just that, running a mile in 3:59.4 and becoming the first person in the record books to run a mile in under four minutes. 
This shift in the benchmark had profound effects; the world now knew that the four-minute mile was possible. Bannister’s record lasted only forty-six days, when it was snatched away by Australian ru…]]></summary>

MongoDB is one of the most popular open-source databases. Unfortunately, this
also means ubiquity of misconfigured and unsecured MongoDB deployments out in
the wild. Just in recent years, we’ve seen several hacks involving thousands
of MongoDB databases left exposed online without any protection, making them
ripe for the hacker’s picking.
It doesn’t have to be this way, though. There are many steps you can take to
keep your MongoDB data safe — from protecting the network perimeter to using
strong transport security to taking advantage of MongoDB’s advanced user
management and role-based access control (RBAC) system.
In this article, we will go over some of the most common ways to securing your

To keep your business secure, it is important not only to keep the hackers from getting in but also to keep your data from getting out. Even if a malicious actor gains access to the server, for example via an SSH session, it is vital to keep the data from being exfiltrated to an unauthorized location, such as IP addresses not under your organization’s control. In considering a solution to protect against data exfiltration, it is critical to note that one policy does not fit all.

Now, we need to strategize how we actually build the authorization mechanism. When talking about application authorizations, we often encounter two concepts RBAC (role-based access control) and ABAC (attribute-based access control).
RBAC: what is it?
With role-based acces…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Any comment?” is probably one of the worst ways to ask for feedback. It’s vague and open ended, and it doesn’t provide any indication of what we’re looking for. Getting good feedback starts earlier than we might expect: it starts with the request. 
It might seem counterintuitive to start the process of receiving feedback with a question, but that makes sense if we realize that getting feedback can be thought of as a form of design research. In the same way that we wouldn’t do any research without the right questions to get the insights that we need, the best way to ask for feedback is also to craft sharp questions.
Design critique is not a one-shot process. Sure, any good feedback workflow continues until the project is finished, but this is particularly true for design because design wor…]]></summary>

As popular as MySQL database is among developers and SQL enthusiasts, it is equally popular amongst hackers. Misconfigured server access, overprivileged roles, and weak authentication schemes are the most common security issues in  MySQL database. While access control features provided by MySQL are adequate enough at the SQL level, it is error-prone to manage access at the operational level. This post aims to give you a brief overview of securing access to production MySQL databases.

Feedback is also one of the most underestimated tools, and often by assuming that we’re already good at it, we settle, forgetting that it’s a skill that can be trained, grown, and improved. Poor feedback can create confusion in projects, bring down morale, and affect trust and team collaboration over the long term. Quality feedback can be a transformative force.

Making frequent changes to cloud applications running in production is the

Git pull requests often serve as a foundational component for triggering code
reviews, Slack notifications, and subsequent automation such as testing and
deployments. This automated process enforces peer reviews and creates enough
visibility to minimize human error. Pull requests work quite well.
But what happens when a production PostgreSQL database, some SSH nodes, or a

One of the first problems the team had to tackle was how to secure the new infrastructure properly, and the team wanted to ensure the best possible results by engaging in an independent audit.
As with the Teleport core product, we engaged with Doyensec to provide an independent security audit of our production environment. At Teleport, we believe independent auditors offer the best insight into where we are weak. In addition, Doyensec has demonstrated that their teams’ skill and attention to detail in attacking our infrastructure are unmatched.
The audit occurred between January 11th and January 29th before we officially launched to customers in March. Therefore, some of the finding…]]></summary>

It takes real portraits and recombines them into fake human faces. We recently scrolled past a LinkedIn post stating that this website could be useful “if you are developing a persona and looking for a photo.” 
We agree: the computer-generated faces could be a great match for personas—but not for the reason you might think. Ironically, the website highlights the core issue of this very common design method: the person(a) does not exist. Like the pictures, personas are artificially made. Information is taken out of natural context and recombined into an isolated snapshot that’s detached from reality. 
But strangely enough, designers use personas to inspire their design for the real world.

Writing a web application that supports securely logging into a website and
managing your credentials is a surprisingly difficult task. You have to develop
a way to manage sessions, understand how browsers store state (cookies), learn
a cryptographically safe password storing technique (like bcrypt), all the
while making sure you mitigate common web security vulnerabilities like
XSS and
CSRF.
Even after you’ve implemented all of the above, you’ll still only be logged
into a single application at a single domain, like example.org.
What if you are running multiple applications under different domains and you
want to transfer your session state to another domain, like example.com or

Authenticator Apps (TOTP) and Hardware Tokens (U2F) such as YubiKeys. But this
support was pretty limited: you could only choose one MFA protocol and users
could only register one device. If a user lost their device, they would be
locked out and need an account reset by the administrator.
So, for Teleport 6.0, we’ve reimplemented the MFA support to make it more
flexible. You can now enable both TOTP and U2F, and each user can have as many
devices registered as they please. If you lose your U2F key but still have a
TOTP app registered, you can log back in and replace your lost U2F key. No need
to nag the cluster admin.

In the 25 years since its founding, computing power and speeds in accordance with Moore’s Law have necessitated increasingly complicated low-level algorithms. This article will focus on asymmetric keygen algorithms.
As of 2020, the most widely adopted algorithms are RSA, DSA, ECDSA, and EdDSA, but it is RSA and EdDSA that provide the best security and performance.

A traditional SSH jump server using OpenSSH. The advantage of this method is that your servers already have OpenSSH pre-installed.
A modern approach using Teleport, a newer open source alternative to OpenSSH.
Both of these servers are easy to install and configure, are free and open-source, and are single-binary Linux daemons.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks allow an attacker to forge and submit
requests as a logged-in user to a web application. CSRF exploits the fact that
HTML elements send ambient credentials (like cookies) with requests, even
cross-origin.
Like XSS, to launch a CSRF attack the attacker has to convince the victim to
either click on or navigate to a link. Unlike XSS, CSRF only allows an attacker
to make requests to the victim’s origin and does not give the attacker code
execution within that origin. This does not mean CSRF attacks are any less
important to defend against. As we’ll see in the examples, CSRF can be as
dangerous as XSS.

If you’ve not used Service Worker yet—and you couldn’t be blamed if so, as it hasn’t seen wide adoption as of 2020—it goes something like this:
On the initial visit to a website, the browser registers what amounts to a client-side proxy powered by a comparably paltry amount of JavaScript that—like a Web Worker—runs on its own thread.
After the Service Worker’s registration, you can intercept requests and decide how to respond to them in the Service Worker’s fetch() event.




What you decide to do with requests you intercept is a) your call and b) depends on your website. You can rewrite requests, precache static assets during install, provide …]]></summary>

Since March 2020, most of us have been working from home, and the days blend into each other and look the same. This is not the first time I have experienced this type of feeling. 
My commute — New York to New Jersey — is what folks in my area call the reverse commute.While going to the office, my days began to look the same: riding the subway to a bus to a shuttle to get to my job. Have you ever arrived at a destination and not even realized how you got there? This is how I began to experience the world everyday. I stopped paying attention to my surroundings.

SSM’s capabilities revolve around managing bare operating-system level details that would otherwise be inaccessible from Amazon’s ever-expanding and all-encompassing aws CLI and API control plane layer. It has grown into having its own dedicated interface within the Amazon AWS console and its underlying system-level agent has been released under an open source software license on Github.

Every cloud has its own identity and access management system. AWS and Google use a bunch
of JSON files specifying various rules. Open source projects like Kubernetes support
three concurrent access control models - attribute-based, role-based and
a webhook access control, all expressed using YAML. Some teams are going as far as
inventing their own programming language to solve this evergreen problem.
As many engineers before us, we faced the challenge of choosing the
design and the tooling from the kaleidoscope of JSON, YAML and custom languages
for our own software’s access controls. Which system is the best, and can there be one language to rule them all?
What are the properties of a good access control system, and what mistakes of the past should we avoid?

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is an attack that allows JavaScript from one site to
run on another. XSS is interesting not due to the technical difficulty of the
attack but rather because it exploits some of the core security mechanisms of
web browsers and because of its sheer pervasiveness. Understanding XSS and its
mitigations provides substantial insight into how the web works and how sites
are safely (and unsafely) isolated from each other.
Background of XSS Attacks
Initially the web was a collection of static HTML documents that the browser would render for users to view. As the web grew, demands for richer documents grew, which led to the development of JavaScript and cookies: JavaScript to make documents interactive and cookies to allow browsers to save the state …]]></summary>

His designs, which included overpasses too low for public buses, have become an often-cited example of exclusionary design and are argued by biographer Robert A. Caro to represent a purposeful barrier between the city’s Black and Puerto Rican residents and nearby beaches. 
Regardless of the details of Moses’s parkway project, it’s a particularly memorable reminder of the political power of design and the ways that choices can exclude various groups based on abilities and resources. The growing interest in inclusive design highlights questions of who can participate, and in relation to the web, this has often meant a focus on accessibility and user experience, as well as on questions related to team diversit…]]></summary>
